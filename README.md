# Introduction

This jupyter notebook illustrates a template workflow for creating and analyzing PIV data of migrating cells in a scratch wound assay. This approach was used in:

### Example Data included
Example Data can be found at this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B9DDFyDq_eGfYQ67aGSZsH4bZiV1iUwT?usp=sharing

It represents 5 frames taken from a DIC movie of MDCK cells migrating and a binary mask of those frames. These frames come from the middle of such an experiment.
